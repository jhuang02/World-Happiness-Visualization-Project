    <h1><a href=".">How is a Country's Perceived Overall Happiness Affected by Various Other Factors?</a></h1>

    <h4>
      What makes us happy? As we transition through different stages of life, we slowly become more aware of our identity and our interests,
      and seek experiences that bring happiness to us individually--but what factors might be contributing to our happiness that we are
      not always explicitly aware of?

    </h4>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Perhaps the country we live in, factors out of our control in our surroundings such as a country's
      socioeconomic status, government, culture, and other more subjective factors relative to the country's own citizens'
      opinions and perceptions are also contributing to a country's happiness. Through creating different visualizations out of
      data regarding happiness in different parts of the world, that incorporate different variables and factors, we hope to explore patterns
      and trends that may reveal insights about what increases or decreases a country's happiness index. We also hope that through
      our exploration, we may perhaps become
      more aware of our own happiness, how happiness can be measured objectively through happiness indexes, how happiness can also
      be subjective through our own perception of happiness, as well its place in our society and our community relative to others'.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In the following exploration of the broad topic of happiness, our metric for happiness is a "happiness score"
      as measured by the average of a country's citizens' responses to the primary life evaluation question from the Gallup World Poll 
      (GWP); our data is taken from the World Happiness Report, a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN),
      which is based off of the poll results from the GWP data. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The primary life evaluation question mentioned above that citizens are responding to is as follows:
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible
      life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you
      personally feel you stand at this time?"
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      This data is taken from nationally representative samples, and includes the estimated extent to which different external factors 
      influence happiness as well. The topic of happiness is inherently subjective and can be influenced by a multitude of factors 
      outside of what is captured by this dataset. Our aim with this exploration is to not make definitive claims about what increases 
      or decreases one's happiness, nor is it to make unsupported generalizations regarding happiness. We understand and recognize that 
      because our data is based on surveyed rankings, there are a myriad of variables outside of our control that could have impacted 
      a particular respondent's ranking, including the respondent's personal circumstances, their mood or emotion at the time of the survey,
      ongoing current political or cultural events,
      etc. We also recognize that variables relevant to different respondents' identities such as whether they are a part of dominant or 
      marginalized communities in the context of race and ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, can also influence such data.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      With all of this in mind, we still believe that the World Happiness Report, and our exploration of the topic of happiness can 
      still be a valuable tool for us to explore and learn about the topic of happiness, and to perhaps gain a better understanding of
      the factors that contribute to our own happiness. 
      In addition, by creating visual representations of happiness data from around the world and from different years, we hope to 
      reveal insights and patterns that may not be immediately apparent from the raw data, and to broaden our own perspectives 
      as we examine happiness data beyond our own country and communities.
      We believe that the inherently open-ended nature of our topic makes room 
      for more interesting and meaningful conversations, and hope that our exploration can act as a catalyst for such discussions, with 
      the aim of inspiring curiosity and further learnings about the topic of happiness.

        This interactive visualization allows viewers to compare the Happiness Scores of different countries using a world map and
        determine trends from geographic location. Viewers can toggle through the years 2015 - 2020 and hovering over a country shows a
        bar graph visualizing how Freedom, Generosity, Government Trust, and Health scores contribute to the overall Happiness score.

        There are many factors at play and we can see that there are large disparities between countries in terms of happiness.
        Let's take a closer look into what factors and variables may be contributing to one's country having higher happiness 
        than another through the following visualizations.

        Social support, as measured in our dataset, is the national average of the binary response (either 0 or 1) to the question of
        “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”
        This interactive scatter plot visualization aims to explore whether there is a relationship between how much a country’s citizens
        feel that they have a support system in their lives, with their happiness index, across the years of 2005-2017.
        The visualization also distinguishes countries by greater region, to allow for deeper insights to be revealed in what trends exist
        between happiness and social support in countries across different regions, as well as allowing viewers to visually see, by color,
        how one region's happiness or social support changes over time.
        In addition to viewing change over time with the slider, one can also hover over a point to see the country name, happiness index,
        and social support score for that year, to allow for more effective user experience with magnified detail on a specific data point.

        How do different factors compare with one another?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Now that we've seen how both health and social support are both factors that generally consistently increase a country's overall happiness, let's compare and examine
        other factors. How does the public perception of the integrity of a government affect if it's people are happy or not? Does it really matter if people are content in other areas? The below
        visualization allows the user to manipulate the level of happiness filter, and only countries with it's people within 0.2 of that level of happiness show up. Users should be able to examine trends in
        dots to see how levels of corruption, health, and social support rise and fall with a country's overall happiness.

      <br />
      <p>

        As we observe rising happiness levels, we see countries that have higher levels of social support and freedom appear. The trend is generally linear, but for
        corruption the story is different. At the highest levels of happiness citizens generally perceive low levels of corruption, but the trend only applies
        until we hit about happiness level of about 6, and from there on corruption levels generally remain stagnant. Interestingly, it seems in a country with moderate levels of happiness,
        the level of perceived corruption in the government has less importance on how happy people are.

        From these two visualizations, we can observe health in countries with varying happiness scores. Here, we measure health 
        with a health index that is represented as a decimal number, where healthier countries have higher health indices and 
        less healthy countries have lower health indices. From the top visualization, we can see that happier countries tend to have 
        higher health indices, while the bottom visualization shows us that less happy countries tend to have lower health indices. 
        This indicates that happier countries tend to be healthier while less happy countries tend to be less healthy.

    <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
    <p>
      From our visualizations, we can see that factors such as freedom and social support are critically important
      in terms of keeping people happy. Any change in the level of freedom and social support directly and consistently affect people's
      happiness. Other factors, like generosity, seem to have low correlation if at all. The countries with the highest levels of
      happiness in recent years don't necessarily have highly generous people, and the same goes the other way around. And then are
      more complicated correlations, such as corruption. Interestingly when asked to rate their perceieved level of corruption in their government, people
      from happier countries often gave the same score as those from less happy ones.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's possible to simply take away that factors like generosity and perceived corruption don't matter, but perhaps the overall story is more complicated than that.
      While it's hard to argue that factors like freedom and the amount of social support people aren't more important, as they have direct impacts on the everyday lives of people,
      we can see at the highest levels of happiness the countries do have low levels of corruption. No country has ever hit above an overall happiness level of 8.5 out of 10, so it's highly possible
      that at these higher levels of happiness these seemingly less important factors start to have an effect, but without these utopias existing yet, it's hard to say.
      <br />
      <br />
      With the countries having the highest amount of people of happy at a grade of B+, it's easy to see we all have room for improvement. While admittedly it is hard to make everyone happy,
      we can analyze data and listen to feedback from people from various countries to see where we can improve. We worked with limited data in our project, and in the future it'd be cool to
      go more in depth and analyze other factors if they were surveyed.
