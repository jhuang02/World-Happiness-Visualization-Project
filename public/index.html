    <h1><a href=".">How is a Country's Perceived Overall Happiness Affected by Various Other Factors?</a></h1>

    <h4>
      What makes us happy? As we transition through different stages of life, we slowly become more aware of our identity and our interests,
      and seek experiences that bring happiness to us individually--but what factors might be contributing to our happiness that we are
      not always explicitly aware of?

    </h4>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Perhaps the country we live in, factors out of our control in our surroundings such as a country's
      socioeconomic status, government, culture, and other more subjective factors relative to the country's own citizens'
      opinions and perceptions are also contributing to a country's happiness. Through creating different visualizations out of
      data regarding happiness in different parts of the world, that incorporate different variables and factors, we hope to explore patterns
      and trends that may reveal insights about what increases or decreases a country's happiness index. We also hope that through
      our exploration, we may perhaps become
      more aware of our own happiness, how happiness can be measured objectively through happiness indexes, how happiness can also
      be subjective through our own perception of happiness, as well its place in our society and our community relative to others'.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In the following exploration of the broad topic of happiness, our metric for happiness is a "happiness score"
      as measured by the average of a country's citizens' responses to the primary life evaluation question from the Gallup World Poll
      (GWP); our data is taken from the World Happiness Report, a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN),
      which is based off of the poll results from the GWP data.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The primary life evaluation question mentioned above that citizens are responding to is as follows:
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible
      life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you
      personally feel you stand at this time?"
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      This data is taken from nationally representative samples, and includes the estimated extent to which different external factors
      influence happiness as well. The topic of happiness is inherently subjective and can be influenced by a multitude of factors
      outside of what is captured by this dataset. Our aim with this exploration is to not make definitive claims about what increases
      or decreases one's happiness, nor is it to make unsupported generalizations regarding happiness. We understand and recognize that
      because our data is based on surveyed rankings, there are a myriad of variables outside of our control that could have impacted
      a particular respondent's ranking, including the respondent's personal circumstances, their mood or emotion at the time of the survey,
      ongoing current political or cultural events,
      etc. We also recognize that variables relevant to different respondents' identities such as whether they are a part of dominant or
      marginalized communities in the context of race and ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, can also influence such data.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      With all of this in mind, we still believe that the World Happiness Report, and our exploration of the topic of happiness can
      still be a valuable tool for us to explore and learn about the topic of happiness, and to perhaps gain a better understanding of
      the factors that contribute to our own happiness.
      In addition, by creating visual representations of happiness data from around the world and from different years, we hope to
      reveal insights and patterns that may not be immediately apparent from the raw data, and to broaden our own perspectives
      as we examine happiness data beyond our own country and communities.
      We believe that the inherently open-ended nature of our topic makes room
      for more interesting and meaningful conversations, and hope that our exploration can act as a catalyst for such discussions, with
      the aim of inspiring curiosity and further learnings about the topic of happiness.

        This interactive visualization allows viewers to compare the Happiness Scores of different countries using a world map and
        determine trends from geographic location. Viewers can toggle through the years 2015 - 2020 and hovering over a country shows a
        bar graph visualizing how Freedom, Generosity, Government Trust, and Health scores contribute to the overall Happiness score.
        This visualization reveals that western countries, and particularly Nordic countries, have some of the highest happiness scores.
        Developing countries, particularly those in Asia and Africa have lower scores. Furthermore, there have not been any significant
        changes in happiness scores over the past 5 years, which can be seen using the year slider.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Design decisions: In order to summarize the data for happiness scores across countries, a map was determined to be the best 
        visualization for doing so as every country can appear in a readable way. For example, 
        if we were to use a bar graph, there would be hundreds of bars if we wanted to include 
        every country. Furthermore, a map allows users to view geographical trends. A color 
        gradient is used for happiness scores to allow for comparisons between countries. 
        Hovering over countries allows users to see what factors contribute to the country’s 
        happiness score and users can also toggle between every year of the data (2015 to 2020).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are many factors at play and we can see that there are large disparities between countries in terms of happiness.
        Let's take a closer look into what factors and variables may be contributing to one's country having higher happiness
        than another through the following visualizations.

      <h3>
        What is the relationship between a country's feeling of social support and its happiness?

      <p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="731" frameborder="0"

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Social support, as measured in our dataset, is the national average of the binary response (either 0 or 1) to the question of
        “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”
        This interactive scatter plot visualization aims to explore whether there is a relationship between how much a country’s citizens
        feel that they have a support system in their lives, with their happiness index, across the years of 2005-2017.
        The visualization also distinguishes countries by greater region, to allow for deeper insights to be revealed in what trends exist
        between happiness and social support in countries across different regions, as well as allowing viewers to visually see, by color,
        how one region's happiness or social support changes over time.
        In addition to viewing change over time with the slider, one can also hover over a point to see the country name, happiness index,
        and social support score for that year, to allow for more effective user experience with magnified detail on a specific data point.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Design decisions: in order to reveal interesting patterns about how relative feelings and perceptions of social support in one's
        country differed in different places from year to year, we chose to use a scatter plot to be able to quickly and clearly
        communicate to the viewer the data and its trends and patterns across the year. We also chose to color code by region to
        reveal even more in depth insights into patterns that were consistent across the years for different regions--for example,
        we can see that in the years 2005-2017, the countries in the Western Europe region tend to have a higher happiness index and a higher
        social support score than the countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa regions. These patterns can be seen quickly visually by the use
        of color coding using a categorical color scheme that is easily visually discernable. In order to color code the data points, we
        needed to clean and process multiple datasets to incorporate regional information into our happiness index data. We also incorporated
        interactive tooltips that magnify information regarding social support and happiness for each data point when the user hovers over
        the point on the scatterplot, and the
        tooltips are also color coded according to the region of the country, allowing for even more functionality and ease of interpretation
        by the user to recognize patterns.

        How do different factors compare with one another?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Now that we've seen how both health and social support are both factors that generally consistently increase a country's overall happiness, let's compare and examine
        other factors. How does the public perception of the integrity of a government affect if it's people are happy or not? Does it really matter if people are content in other areas? The below
        visualization allows the user to manipulate the level of happiness filter, and only countries with it's people within 0.2 of that level of happiness show up. Users should be able to examine trends in
        dots to see how levels of corruption, health, and social support rise and fall with a country's overall happiness.
        <br><br><br>

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>

        As we observe rising happiness levels, we see countries that have higher levels of social support and freedom appear. The trend is generally linear, but for
        corruption the story is different. At the highest levels of happiness citizens generally perceive low levels of corruption, but the trend only applies
        until we hit about happiness level of about 6, and from there on corruption levels generally remain stagnant. Interestingly, it seems in a country with moderate levels of happiness,
        the level of perceived corruption in the government has less importance on how happy people are.
        </br>
        </br>
        Design decisions: The goal was to as directly as possible show how different factors correlate with different levels of happiness. Allowing the user to manipulate
        the level of happiness allowed them to manipulate the visualization themselves and watch how the levels of social support, freedom, and corruption rise and fell. These
        trends would be easily viewable in a scatterplot, while not being overly busy with data. When the user does want to look into the data more, we decided to add
        tooltips that would reveal more exact information upon hover. The color scale is not as necessary in this visualization, as the levels of these factors are already conveyed by location
        on the plot, but we wanted the color scheme to be consistent across visualizations and applied it here as well. Our scales on our axises were also chosen in a way to be able to discern
        differences in location reasonably well, while also importantly allowing all three factor plots to be viewable at once on the webpage.

        How does health play a role between the happiest and least happy countries?

      <br />
      <p>
        From these two visualizations, we can observe health in countries with varying happiness scores. Here, we measure health
        with a health index that is represented as a decimal number, where healthier countries have higher health indices and
        less healthy countries have lower health indices. From the top visualization, we can see that happier countries tend to have
        higher health indices, while the bottom visualization shows us that less happy countries tend to have lower health indices.
        This indicates that happier countries tend to be healthier while less happy countries tend to be less healthy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Design decisions: Our goal was to see how health varies as happiness varies. We decided to visualize this through two bar graphs: one that depicted happiness scores and health indices for the 25 happiest countries, and one for the 25 least happy countries. We chose this design because we thought using two bar graphs can allow users to easily see the differences in health between happiest and least happy countries. We chose to depict happiness scores through the bars so that users can visually see the differences between happiness scores. We also displayed the happiness score above each bar so that it is clear what the exact happiness score is. We made the y-axis for both graphs the same (from 0.0 to 8.0) so that the comparisons between bar heights would be more accurate between the two graphs. We chose the range 0.0 to 8.0 because the happiness scores in the data we used for the graphs ranged between 0.0 and 8.0.  For health indices, we decided to show this through a color gradient, with lighter colors indiciating lower health indices and darker colors indicating higher health indices, so that users can see the differences in health indices by simply seeing whether the bars are lighter or darker in color. We included a legend so that users will understand what the colors mean. We wanted to add some interactive elements as well so that users can play around with the graphs. We added a slider that changes the data in both graphs to the data from the year the slider is currently on. The slider ranges from 2015-2020, and users can slide the slider to a specific year. This allows users to analyze any trends in health and happiness throughout the years. We also added tooltips so that when users hover over each bar, they can see the exact happiness score value and health index value.

      This interactive visualization allows viewers to compare how a country’s Freedom, Generosity, Government Trust, and Health scores impact the overall Happiness
      Score of the top 20 countries from the year 2015- 2020. By using the color gradient for each index score, viewers can determine the weight that each category
      had on the overall happiness score for the top 20 countries. Using this visualization, you can see that the Freedom and Health Index has a strong correlation
      to the rankings of a country's happiness index while there is less of a correlation for Government Trust, and Generosity Index. This suggests that on average,
      if a country has a high Freedom or Heath Index then they also have a high Happiness Index whereas the same conclusion can not necessarily be made for Government Trust and Generosity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Design decisions: In order to visualize how different factors impact happiness scores, 
      we decided to show the top 20 countries in a bar graph. The number 20 was chosen so 
      that enough bars were on the graph to reveal any trends but not too many as to make it 
      readable. A bar graph was chosen to allow for comparisons between countries and the 
      y-axis starts at 6.0 in order to highlight the differences between happiness scores. 
      Otherwise, decimal differences between happiness scores of countries is hard to see.  
      A color gradient is used on the bar in order to show how much each factor is 
      contributing to the happiness score and viewers can scroll through each of the 4 graphs to compare and spot trends.

    <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
    <p>
      From our visualizations, we can see that factors such as freedom and social support are critically important
      in terms of keeping people happy. Any change in the level of freedom and social support directly and consistently affect people's
      happiness. Other factors, like generosity, seem to have low correlation if at all. The countries with the highest levels of
      happiness in recent years don't necessarily have highly generous people, and the same goes the other way around. And then are
      more complicated correlations, such as corruption. Interestingly when asked to rate their perceieved level of corruption in their government, people
      from happier countries often gave the same score as those from less happy ones.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's possible to simply take away that factors like generosity and perceived corruption don't matter, but perhaps the overall story is more complicated than that.
      While it's hard to argue that factors like freedom and the amount of social support people aren't more important, as they have direct impacts on the everyday lives of people,
      we can see at the highest levels of happiness the countries do have low levels of corruption. No country has ever hit above an overall happiness level of 8.5 out of 10, so it's highly possible
      that at these higher levels of happiness these seemingly less important factors start to have an effect, but without these utopias existing yet, it's hard to say.
      <br />
      <br />
      With the countries having the highest amount of people of happy at a grade of B+, it's easy to see we all have room for improvement. While admittedly it is hard to make everyone happy,
      we can analyze data and listen to feedback from people from various countries to see where we can improve. We worked with limited data in our project, and in the future it'd be cool to
      go more in depth and analyze other factors if they were surveyed.
      <br />
      <br />
      From our visualizations, we can see that there is indeed some relationship between happiness index and external factors.
      In our exploration, we specifically examined the factors of freedom, government trust, generosity, health index, social support,
      and corruption, but there are a myriad of additional factors that can be further explored, in the areas of economics, politics,
      social issues, culture, societal standards and traditions, and more. This acts as a foundation for even further work and exploring
      to be done, which can act as a stepping stone for future conversations to be made to further broaden our perspectives of what
      happiness is, and what is consciously and subconsciously contributing to each of our happiness levels. In the factors that
      we explored above, we can see there is a general positive relationship between the factor and happiness index (aside from
      corruption, which was not as strongly correlated as we expected, but still more of a negative relationship). Although
      we cannot definitively claim that these factors have a direct relationship to happiness, as we recognize the existence
      of other variables and environmental/community factors, we can still observe potential relationships, and these observations
      can still broaden our perspectives a bit about what is influencing happiness, as well as how this differs across different
      geographic locations outside of our own country and region.
      <br />
      <br />
      As we mentioned in the beginning, happiness is an extremely nuanced and subjective topic. We hope that our visualizations can
      help to shed light on the factors that may be correlated to happiness levels, as well as bringing awareness to some of our
      own privilege. For example, we can observe from our happiness vs. social support scatterplot that countries in the European
      and North American regions tend to have higher happiness indexes as well. Though we cannot claim that this is causation
      and not merely correlation, we can still think more deeply about the potential that there is a direct causal relationship here,
      and think about how countries in this region tend to not have as much severe political turmoil, economic insecurity, or
      social isolation as countries in some other regions may. Another example is the bar chart visualization we created that
      looks at health index. Again, there seems to be a positive relationship between health index and happiness index, and
      we can begin to consider how healthcare differs across countries and regions across the world. Some developed countries like
      our own have much more accessible access to healthcare than others, and it is just a reality of our circumstances and
      environment that we have
      the privilege to have access to more affordable healthcare and advanced medicine.
      <br />
      <br />
      With this in mind, in the greater context of current events in the world,
      we see that the country we live in, in regards to developing or developed country, may inherently play a role in our happiness
      levels, and we can take a step in becoming more aware of these circumstances to not take our privileges for granted, and take
      actionable steps in whatever way we choose to. We hope that through our exploration of "what makes us happy", we were able to
      spark meaningful reflection and conversation about the topic of happiness, and motivate deeper exploration into the topic so
      we can become more educated and aware as individuals.
