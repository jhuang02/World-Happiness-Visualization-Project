    <h4>
      What makes us happy? As we transition through different stages of life, we slowly become more aware of our identity and our interests,
      and seek experiences that bring happiness to us individually--but what factors might be contributing to our happiness that we are
      not always explicitly aware of?

    </h4>
    <p>
      Perhaps the country we live in, factors out of our control in our surroundings such as a country's
      socioeconomic status, government, culture, and other more subjective factors relative to the country's own citizens'
      opinions and perceptions are also contributing to a country's happiness. Through creating different visualizations out of
      data regarding happiness in different parts of the world, that incorporate different variables and factors, we hope to explore patterns
      and trends that may reveal insights about what increases or decreases a country's happiness index. We also hope that through
      our exploration, we may perhaps become
      more aware of our own happiness, how happiness can be measured objectively through happiness indexes, how happiness can also
      be subjective through our own perception of happiness, as well its place in our society and our community relative to others'.

      This interactive visualization allows viewers to compare the Happiness Scores of different countries using a world map and
      determine trends from geographic location. Viewers can toggle through the years 2015 - 2020 and hovering over a country shows a
      bar graph visualizing how Freedom, Generosity, Government Trust, and Health scores contribute to the overall Happiness score.

        Social support, as measured in our dataset, is the national average of the binary response (either 0 or 1) to the question of
        “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”
        This interactive scatter plot visualization aims to explore whether there is a relationship between how much a country’s citizens
        feel that they have a support system in their lives, with their happiness index, across the years of 2005-2017.
        The visualization also distinguishes countries by greater region, to allow for deeper insights to be revealed in what trends exist
        between happiness and social support in countries across different regions, as well as allowing viewers to visually see, by color,
        how one region's happiness or social support changes over time.
        In addition to viewing change over time with the slider, one can also hover over a point to see the country name, happiness index,
        and social support score for that year, to allow for more effective user experience with magnified detail on a specific data point.

        Now that we've seen how both health and social support are both factors that generally consistently increase a country's overall happiness, let's compare and examine
        other factors. How does the public perception of the integrity of a government affect if it's people are happy or not? Does it really matter if people are content in other areas? The below
        visualization allows the user to manipulate the level of happiness filter, and only countries with it's people within 0.2 of that level of happiness show up. Users should be able to examine trends in
        dots to see how levels of corruption, health, and social support rise and fall with a country's overall happiness.

        As we observe rising happiness levels, we see countries that have higher levels of social support and freedom appear. The trend is generally linear, but for
        corruption the story is different. At the highest levels of happiness citizens generally perceive low levels of corruption, but the trend only applies
        until we hit about happiness level of about 6, and from there on corruption levels generally remain stagnant. Interestingly, it seems in a country with moderate levels of happiness,
        the level of perceived corruption in the government has less importance on how happy people are.

        This interactive visualization allows users to look at the impact of countries' health on their overall happiness score from 2015-2020.
        The top visulization shows the 25 happiest countries' health index and happiness scores from 2015-2020, and the bottom visualization
        shows the 25 least happy countries' health index and happiness scores from 2015-2020. Users can move the slider to see data for
        different years and to compare the health indices in happier countries to the health indices in less happy countries. This is a rough
        draft - we will add in tooltips and possibly other interactive elements in the final draft.

      This interactive visualization allows viewers to compare how a country’s Freedom, Generosity, Government Trust, and Health scores
      impact the overall Happiness Score of the top 20 countries from the year 2015- 2020. By using the color gradient for each index score,
      viewers can determine the weight that each category had on the overall happiness score for the top 20 countries.
